# Python Code Analyzer

A simple Python desktop app built with Tkinter that helps you analyze your code! This tool runs **Radon** to check for cyclomatic complexity and **pycodestyle** for PEP8 style issues, then displays color-coded results in a user-friendly interface.

---

## What does this project do? Who is it for?

This application is designed for:

- **Developers** who want to improve their code quality.
- **Anyone** writing Python files and curious about code complexity and style issues.

Simply upload a `.py` file, analyze it, and generate a reportâ€”all in one place!

---

## Key Features

- Open and analyze any `.py` code file.
- Check cyclomatic complexity using **Radon**.
- Identify PEP8 style violations with **pycodestyle**.
- See results in a scrollable text pane with color-coded highlights.
